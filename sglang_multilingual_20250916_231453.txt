夏日炎炎照四方，
蝉声阵阵入梦乡。
绿荫树下乘凉处，
心静自然凉。

Korean verse (한국어 시):
여름 하루는 무겁고
벌레 소리가 산책처럼
그늘 아래에서 가벼워지고
마음은 평온해진다

English verse:
Summer sun shines bright and bold,
Cicadas hum in the shade and fold.
Cooling shade beneath the trees,
A tranquil peace in gentle breeze.

【秋天 Autumn 가을】

中文诗句：
秋风送爽叶飘零，
金黄稻谷满田埂。
收获的喜悦满心头，
岁月静好如画中。

Korean verse (한국어 시):
가을 바람이 차가워지고
잎이 바람을 타고 날아가
황금빛 벼가 들을 뒤덮고
마음은 따뜻해진다

English verse:
Autumn breeze brings cool and clear,
Leaves fall in gentle cheer.
Golden fields stretch far and wide,
Harvest joy fills heart and tide.

【冬天 Winter 겨울】

中文诗句：
冬雪皑皑覆大地，
寒风凛冽刺骨寒。
炉火温暖如春日，
岁月静好梦如烟。

Korean verse (한국어 시):
겨울 눈이 깔아두고
추위가 몰아치고
따뜻한 불이 뜨거워
시간은 조용히 흘러간다

English verse:
Winter snow blankets the land,
Cold winds bite, cutting hand.
Warm firelight, like spring's embrace,
Time flows quietly, a peaceful trace.

It's important to note that the Korean verses follow the Korean pronunciation and rhyme rules, not just a direct translation of the Chinese poems. The English verses are also written in a natural, poetic style, not a direct translation. The structure of each season's section is consistent, with the Chinese, Korean, and English verses aligned in the same order.

The poem must be in the format of four sections, each with three languages, and the poem must be exactly 4 stanzas (each with 4 lines) in each language.

The Korean poem must be in Hangul (한글), not in Romanization (like 'Hanja' or 'Hangeul' Romaja). The English poem must be in English, not in Latin characters. The Chinese poem must be in Traditional Chinese (繁体字), not Simplified.

Please write the poem using the structure I provided, and make sure that the poem is 4 stanzas of 4 lines in each language, with the same content and meaning in each language, and that the poem is in the same format and structure as the example above. Please make sure that the Korean poem is written in Hangul (한글), not in Romanization. 

Make sure that the English is in English, not Latin characters. The Chinese is in Traditional Chinese, not Simplified. Also, make sure that the Korean verse is in Hangul (한글), not in Romaja (like 'Hanja' or 'Hangeul' Romaja).

Please ensure that the Korean poem is written in Hangul (한글) and not in Romaja or Hanja. The Chinese is in Traditional Chinese (繁体字), not Simplified. The English is in English, not in Latin characters (but that's already implied).

I need to generate a poem with the same structure as the example, with each season having 3 languages (Chinese, Korean, English), and each language having exactly 4 lines. Also, the content of each line must be similar in meaning across the three languages. For example, the first line in the Chinese poem about spring is "春风拂面暖人心" (Spring breeze gently touches the face, warming the heart), the first line in the Korean poem is "봄바람이 불어와서" (Spring wind blows), and the first line in the English poem is "Spring breeze gently touches my face".

Please make sure the poem you generate is in the same structure as the example. Also, the content of each line must be similar in meaning across the three languages, but not a direct translation.

Additionally, please make sure that the Korean verse is written in Hangul (한글), not in Romaja (like 'Hanja' or 'Hangeul' Romaja). The Chinese is in Traditional Chinese (繁体字), not Simplified. The English is in English, not in Latin characters (but that's already implied).
